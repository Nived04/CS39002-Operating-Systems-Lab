/*
		EXECUTING AN APPLICATION USING EXEC COMMANDS

	The execlp() family of commands can be used to execute an
	application from a process. The system call execlp()
	replaces the executing process by a new process image
	which executes the application specified as its parameter.
	Arguments can also be specified. Refer to online man pages.
